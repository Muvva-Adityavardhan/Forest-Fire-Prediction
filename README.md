# 🌲 Forest Fire Prediction System 🔥

This project uses **Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier)** to predict the occurrence of forest fires using **Vapor Pressure Deficit (VPD)** and environmental variables.

## 🧠 Overview

Forest fires are a serious threat to biodiversity, ecosystems, and human settlements.  
This project aims to predict the likelihood of forest fires by analyzing climatic factors such as temperature, humidity, and VPD using machine learning.

- 📈 Accuracy Achieved: **99.84%**
- 📊 Algorithm Used: **Random Forest Classifier**
- 🧪 Key Feature: **VPD (Vapor Pressure Deficit)**
- 🌐 Web Interface: Built using **Flask + HTML/CSS**
